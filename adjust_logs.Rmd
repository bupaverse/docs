# Adjusting logs

The _mapping_ of a log is defined by the different variables which are mapped onto the specific characteristics.

For an `eventlog`:

*	case identifier (`case_id`)
*	activity type (`activity_id`)
*	activity instance (`activity_instance_id`)
*	transaction status (`lifecycle_id`) 
* 	timestamp (`timestamp`)
*	resource (`resource`)

For an `activitylog`:

*	case identifier (`case_id`)
*	activity type (`activity_id`)
* 	timestamps (`timestamps`)
*	resource (`resource`)

More information on these characteristics can be found [here](http://bupar.net/creating_eventlogs.html). Each of these can be modified to approach event logs from a different angle. This can be done using the `eventlog()` or `activitylog()`-function, auxiliary  `set_`-functions, or by using an existing mapping.

```{r message = F, warning = F}
library(bupaR)
```


## Using `eventlog()`/`activitylog()` 

The `eventlog()` and `activitylog()` functions are not only used to instantiate a `log` object, but can also be used to modify it, by using a `log` object as input and setting only the identifiers one wants to change. 

For example, consider the `traffic_fines` data. We could change `case_id` argument to the vehicleclass column as follows (This is a purely hypothetical example). You will see that the number of cases has changed after this modification. 

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	eventlog(case_id = "vehicleclass")
```

## Using `set_` functions

If we only want to change one of the elements, as in the example above, the `set()` function provide a very convenient way to do so. The same change as before can be done as follows:

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	set_case_id("vehicleclass")
```

## Using existing mapping

It is also possible to extract the `log` mapping at a certain point of time using the `mapping()` function.

```{r}
mapping_fines <- mapping(traffic_fines)
mapping_fines
```

We can adjust the mapping incrementally by using the described approaches above.

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	set_case_id("vehicleclass") %>%
	set_activity_id("notificationtype") -> traffic_fines
```

Later, we can always undo these changes and "reset" the original mapping using the `re_map` function. 

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	re_map(mapping_fines)
```

```{r footer, results = "asis", echo = F}
CURRENT_PAGE <-  stringr::str_replace(knitr::current_input(), ".Rmd",".html")
res <- knitr::knit_expand("_button_footer.Rmd", quiet = TRUE)
res <- knitr::knit_child(text = unlist(res), quiet = TRUE)
cat(res, sep = '\n')
```
