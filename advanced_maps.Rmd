```{r include = F}
library(bupaverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.height=3)
```

```{r eval = F}
library(bupaverse)
```


## Combining different profiles

The profile used for nodes and edges can be differentiated using the `type_nodes` and `type_edges` attributes instead of the `type` argument. In this way, information about frequencies and performance, or any other value, can be combined in the same graph.

```{r fig.height=2}
patients %>%
	process_map(type_nodes = frequency("relative_case"),
				type_edges = performance(mean))
```


## Adding secondary information

You can add a second layer of information to both nodes and edges. 

```{r}
patients %>%
	process_map(type = frequency("relative_case"),
				sec = frequency("absolute"))
```

Both primary and secondary layers can be differentiated between nodes and edges. 

```{r warning = F}
patients %>%
	process_map(type_nodes =  frequency("relative_case"),
				type_edges = performance(units = "hours"),
				sec_nodes = frequency("absolute"),
				sec_edges = performance(FUN = max, units = "hours"))
```

## Customizing colors

Both `frequency()` and `performance()` have the argument `color_scale` and `color_edges` to customize the colors in the process map: 

* `color_scale`: set the color scale to fill the nodes. Can be any of the scales in `RColorBrewer::brewer.pal.info`. Defaults to _PuBu_ (frequency) or _Reds_ (performance)
* `color_edges`: any single color to apply to the arrows. Can be a named color, hex-code, or a result of `rgb`. Defaults to _dodgerblue4_ (frequency) or _red4_ (performance)

Configuring the colors can be useful to harmonize the process map aesthetics when using differing layers for nodes and edges. 

```{r fig.height=2}
patients %>%
	process_map(type_nodes = frequency("relative_case", color_scale = "PuBu"),
				type_edges = performance(mean, color_edges = "dodgerblue4"))
```

## Customizing the layout

The layout of the process map can be further customized: 

*	Instead of a left-right (LR) layout, the `rankdir` can be set to TB (top-bottom), BT (bottom-top) or RL (right-left).
*	The varying edge width can be disabled.
*	If `render` is set to `FALSE`, the function will return an unrendered graph, which can be further modified. See [here](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/) for more information.
