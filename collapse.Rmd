# Collapse Activities

```{r include = F}
library(bupaverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.height = 3)
```

```{r eval = F}
library(bupaverse)
```

Using `act_collapse()` you can replace a set of closely related activities by one higher-level activity. For example, consider the process map of `patients` data set. 

```{r}
patients %>%
	process_map()
```

Let's say we want to combine the activities _Blood test_, _MRI SCAN_ and _X-Ray_ scan into a single _Examination_ activity. This can be done as follows: 

```{r}
patients %>%
	act_collapse(Examination = c("Blood test","MRI SCAN","X-Ray")) %>%
	process_map()
```







```{r footer, results = "asis", echo = F}
CURRENT_PAGE <-  stringr::str_replace(knitr::current_input(), ".Rmd",".html")
res <- knitr::knit_expand("_button_footer.Rmd", quiet = TRUE)
res <- knitr::knit_child(text = unlist(res), quiet = TRUE)
cat(res, sep = '\n')
```
