# Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ is a living document. If you haven't found the answer to your question here or anywhere else on our website, contact us via [support@bupar.net](mailto:support@bupar.net), and we will get back to you as soon as we can. If you want to notify us of a bug in one of the `bupaR`-packages, please submit an issue on the respective [GitHub-repository](https://github.com/bupaverse).

## Create

```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
card(card_header(class = "card text-white bg-secondary mb-3", "What is an activity instance identifier, and when do I need one?"),
	 card_body(htmltools::HTML("The activity instance identifier is a unique identifier for each activity instance, i.e. one specific execution of an activity for a specific case. If an activity exist of more than a single event, for example a <i>start</i> and a <i>complete</i> event, the activity instance identifier is needed to make sure these events are connected to each other.")),
	 card_body(htmltools::HTML("When you don't have multiple events per activity instance, i.e. each activity only has one registrered timestamp, the activity instance identifier is redundant. In that case, you can use the <code>activitylog</code> object class, as specified in <a href = 'create_logs.html#Scenario_1'>Scenario 1</a>.")),
	 card_body(htmltools::HTML("If your log has multiple events for the same activity instance, but there is no variable that can serve as an activity instance identifier to connect them, you can try <a href = 'create_logs.html#Missing_activity_instance_id'> <code>assign_instance_id()</code></a>.")))
```

```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
card(card_header(class = "card text-white bg-secondary mb-3", "Creating the event log takes a lot of time. What can I do?"),
	 card_body(htmltools::HTML("By default, <code>eventlog()</code> will perform some checks to make sure the provided mapping corresponds to the data model. This means that each value of the <code>activity_instance_id</code> should be connected to a single <code>case_id</code> and a single <code>activity_id</code>. For larger event logs, this does take some time. You can circumvent these by setting the argument <code>validate = FALSE</code>.")),
	 card_body(htmltools::HTML("Alternatively, you might want to have a look at the different <a href = 'create_logs.html#The_right_log_for_the_job'>scenarios<a> to decide whether you need an <code>eventlog</code> or <code>activitylog</code> object. The <code>activitylog</code> is a simplified object class that does not require special validation. ")))
```

## Visualize

```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
card(card_header(class = "card text-white bg-success mb-3", "How can I remove infrequent edges in a process map?"),
	 card_body(htmltools::HTML("<code>bupaR</code> does not contain a magic slider that can simplify a <code>process_map</code>. We believe that process maps should always be a transparent visualization of the log, and simplifying should be done by the conscious use of filters. You might consider <a href= 'case_filters.html#Infrequent_Flows'><code>filter_infrequent_flows()</code></a>, <a href = 'case_filters.html#Trace_Frequency'><code>filter_trace_frequency()</code></a> or <a href = 'case_filters.html#Activity_Frequency'><code>filter_activity_frequency()</code></a> for this job.")))
```

```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
card(card_header(class = "card text-white bg-success mb-3", "Can I use process maps in a Shiny app?"),
	 card_body(htmltools::HTML("Yes, you can! Use the functions <code>renderProcessMap()</code> in the Server, and <code>processMapOutput</code> in the UI of your app. Make sure to use the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> arguments to set proper dimensions for the map.")))
```

```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
card(card_header(class = "card text-white bg-success mb-3", "Can I save the process map to a file?"),
	 card_body(htmltools::HTML("You can save a process map to a PDF, PNG, PS or EPS using <code>export_map()</code>. To do this, note that you should use the argument <code>render = FALSE</code> in the call to <code>process_map()</code>. Use the argument <code>title</code> to add a caption to the image, and <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> to adjust the file dimensions.")))
