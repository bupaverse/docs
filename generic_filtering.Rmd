## filter

Generic filtering of events can be done using the `filter` function, which takes an event log and any number of logical conditions. The example below filters events which have vehicleclas "C" and amount greater than 300. More process-specific filtering methods can be found [here](http://www.bupar.net/subsetting.html).

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	filter(vehicleclass == "C", amount > 300)
```


## slice 

An eventlog can be _sliced_, which mean returning a slice, i.e. a subset, from the eventlog, based on row number. There are three ways to slice event logs

*	Using `slice`: take a slice of cases
*	Using `slice_activities`: take a slice of activity instances
*	Using `slice_events`: take a slice of events

The next piece of code returns the _first_ 10 cases. Note that first here is defined by the current order of the data set, not by time.

```{r}
patients %>%
	slice(1:10)
```

### slice_activities

The next piece of code returns the _first_ 10 activity instances.

```{r}
patients %>%
	slice_activities(1:10)
```


### slice_events

The next piece of code returns the _first_ 10 events. 

```{r}
patients %>% 
	slice_events(1:10)
```


## first_n, last_n

The slice function select events, cases or activity instances based on their current position in the event data. As such, the result can be changed using the `arrange` function. More often, we want to select the first _n_ activity instances, or the last ones. This is achieved with the `first_n` or `last_n` functions, which return the first, resp. last, n activity instances of a log based on time, not on position.

```{r}
patients %>% 
	first_n(n = 5)
```

This is not impacted by a different ordering of the data since it will take the time aspect into account. 

```{r}
patients %>%
	arrange(desc(time)) %>%
	first_n(n = 5)
```

Incombination with `group_by_case`, it is very easy to select the heads or tails of each case. Below, we explore the 95% most common first 3 activities in the `sepsis` log.

```{r}
sepsis %>%
	group_by_case() %>%
	first_n(3) %>%
	trace_explorer(coverage = 0.95)
```



## sample_n

The `sample_n` function allows to take a sample of the event log containing n cases. The code below returns a sample of 10 patients.

```{r}
patients %>%
	sample_n(size = 10)
```
Note that this function can also be used with a sample size bigger than the number of cases in the event log, if you allow for the replacements of drawn cases.

A more extensive list of subsetting methods is provided by edeaR. Look [here](http://www.bupar.net/subsetting.html) for more information.


```{r footer, results = "asis", echo = F}
CURRENT_PAGE <-  stringr::str_replace(knitr::current_input(), ".Rmd",".html")
res <- knitr::knit_expand("_button_footer.Rmd", quiet = TRUE)
res <- knitr::knit_child(text = unlist(res), quiet = TRUE)
cat(res, sep = '\n')
```
