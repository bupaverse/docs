knitr::include_graphics("images/icons/pm.PNG")

# Performance profile

```{r include = F}
library(bupaverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.height=3)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = "100%")
```

```{r eval = F}
library(bupaverse)
```


Instead of a frequencies, process maps can also be used to visualize performance of the process, by using `performance()` to configure the map, instead of `frequency()`. 

```{r}
patients %>%
	process_map(performance())
```

There are three different parameters specific to the `performance()` configuration: the aggregation function, the time units, and the flow time type. 

## Aggregation function

The `FUN` argument specifies the aggregation function to apply on the processing time (e.g. min, max, mean, median, etc.). By default, the _mean_ durations are shown. We can adjust this to the maximum, for example. 

```{r}
patients %>%
	process_map(performance(FUN = max))
```

Any function that takes a numerical vector and returns a single value can be used. For example, let's say we want to show the 0.90 percentile. 

```{r}
p90 <- function(x, ...) {
	quantile(x, probs = 0.9, ...)
}

patients %>%
	process_map(performance(FUN = p90))
```

Note that the `...` is mandatory as `process_map` will automatically add `na.rm = T` to the aggregation function call. 

## Time units


The `units` argument allows to specificy the time unit to be used.

```{r fig.height=2}
patients %>%
	process_map(performance(mean, "days"))
patients %>%
	process_map(performance(mean, "hours"))
```

## Flow time type

Finally, you can set the `flowt_time` argument. 

There are two different duration types that can be displayed on the edges.

*	`idle_time`: the time between the end of the source-activity, and the start of the target-activity. Can be negative if the source-activity overlaps with the target-activity.
*	`inter_start_time`: the time between the __start__ of the source and target activities, __including__ the duration of the from-activity. 

```{r footer, results = "asis", echo = F}
CURRENT_PAGE <-  stringr::str_replace(knitr::current_input(), ".Rmd",".html")
res <- knitr::knit_expand("_button_footer.Rmd", quiet = TRUE)
res <- knitr::knit_child(text = unlist(res), quiet = TRUE)
cat(res, sep = '\n')
```
