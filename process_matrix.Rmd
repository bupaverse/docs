A process matrix is a two-dimensional matrix showing the flows between activities. Its configuration is exactly the same as those used by `process_map`, and can thus be the following. 

*	[`frequency()`](frequency_maps.html)
	*	Absolute frequency of flows
	*	Relative case frequency of flows
	*	Relative frequency of flows, for each antecendent
		*	I.e. given antecendent A, it is followed x% of the time by Consequent B
	*	Relative frequency of flows, for each consequent
		*	I.e. given consequent B, it is preceded x% of the time by Antecedent A
* 	[`performance()`](performance_maps.html)
	*   aggregation function x time unite x flow time type
	
The result of `process_matrix()` is is a data.frame with antecedent-consequent pairs, which can be visualized using `plot()`.

### Absolute

```{r out.width = "100%"}
traffic_fines %>%
	process_matrix(frequency("absolute")) 
traffic_fines %>%
	process_matrix(frequency("absolute")) %>%
	plot()
```


### Relative-case

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	process_matrix(frequency("relative-case")) 
traffic_fines %>%
	process_matrix(frequency("relative-case")) %>%
	plot()
```


### Relative-antecedent

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	process_matrix(frequency("relative-antecedent")) 
traffic_fines %>%
	process_matrix(frequency("relative-antecedent")) %>%
	plot()
```


### Relative-consequent


```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	process_matrix(frequency("relative-consequent")) 
traffic_fines %>%
	process_matrix(frequency("relative-consequent")) %>%
	plot()
```

## Performance 
<div class = "blue">

```{r}

	process_matrix(performance(FUN = mean, units = "weeks")) 
traffic_fines %>%
	process_matrix(performance(FUN = mean, units = "weeks"))  %>%
	plot()
