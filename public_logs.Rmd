# Public logs

The `eventdataR` package contains several real-life and artificial event logs. Each can be loaded using the `data` function. The currently available event logs are listed below. More event logs will be added in the future.

## Real-life data

### Sepsis

```{r}
sepsis
```

### Hospital Log

```{r}
hospital
```

### Hospital Billing

```{r}
hospital_billing
```

### Road Traffic Fine Management

```{r}

```

## Artifical data

### Patients

Artificial eventlog about patients arriving in an emergency department of a hospital. This event log was used as the running example in the journal paper entitled [Retrieving batch organisation of work insights from event logs](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923617300374).


```{r message = F, warning = F}
library(eventdataR)
patients %>% summary
```

### Patients activitylog

Equivalent process log of patient but stored as an activity log. 

```{r}
patients_act
```
