# Unite activities

You can use `act_unite()` to remove unwanted differences between activities. For example, consider the `sepsis` activities. 

```{r}
sepsis %>%
	activities()
```

We can replace all `Release X` activities with a single unique `Release` activity. 

```{r}
sepsis %>%
	act_unite(Release = c("Release A","Release B","Release C","Release D","Release E")) %>%
	activities()
```

Note that, in contrast with `act_collapse()`, the number of activity instances will never be changed by `act_unite()`. Only the labels of existing activity instances will be changed. On the other hand `act_collapse()` merges multiple activity instances into a new instance.



```{r footer, results = "asis", echo = F}
CURRENT_PAGE <-  stringr::str_replace(knitr::current_input(), ".Rmd",".html")
res <- knitr::knit_expand("_button_footer.Rmd", quiet = TRUE)
res <- knitr::knit_child(text = unlist(res), quiet = TRUE)
cat(res, sep = '\n')
```
