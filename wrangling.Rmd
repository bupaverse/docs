# Wrangling

```{r eval = F}
library(bupaverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r include = F}
library(bupaverse)
library(dplyr)
```


In order to easily manipulate logs, well-known [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)-verbs have been adapted. This page serves as a general introduction of the wrangling verbs. Their usage is illustrated through the documentation for _Manipulation_, _Analysis_ and _Visualization_. 

## group_by

Using the `group_by` function, event logs can be grouped according to a (set of) variables, such that all further computations happen for each of these different groups.

In the next example, the number of cases are computed for each value of "vehicleclass".

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	group_by(vehicleclass) %>%
	n_cases()
```

### Predefined groupings

For specific groupings, some auxiliary functions are available. 

*	`group_by_case` - group by cases
*	`group_by_activity` - group by activity types
*	`group_by_resource` - group by resources
*	`group_by_activity_resource` - group by activity resource pair
*	`group_by_activity_instance` - group by activity instances.

For example, the number of cases in which a specific resource occurs, can be computed as follows.

```{r}
sepsis %>%
	group_by_resource %>%
	n_cases()
```


Note that each of the descriptive metrics discussed [here](http://www.bupar.net/exploring.html) can be rewritten using these lower-level functions. The example above is equal to the `resource_involvement` metric at case level. 


### Grouping on (a set of) ids

When you want to group on a combination of mapping variables, for example, for each combination of _case_ and _activity_, you can use `group_by_ids()`. The following examples counts the number of events per case and per activity. 

```{r}
patients %>%
	group_by_ids(case_id, activity_id) %>%
	n_events()	
```
Note that the arguments of `group_by_ids()` are not the variable names of case (_patient_) and activity (_handling_) columns, but unqouted mapping id-functions. You can thus use this function while being agnostic of the precise variable names. 

### Remove grouping 

When a grouping is no longer needed, it can be removed using the `ungroup_eventlog` function. 

## mutate

You can use `mutate` to add new variables to an event log, possibly by using existing variables. In the next example, the total amount of lacticacid is computed for each case. [Read more.](mutate.html)

```{r echo = F}
sepsis %>%
	mutate(lacticacid = as.numeric(lacticacid)) -> sepsis
```


```{r}
sepsis %>%
	group_by_case() %>%
	mutate(total_lacticacid = sum(lacticacid, na.rm = T))
```

## filter

Generic filtering of events can be done using `filter()`, which takes an event log and any number of logical conditions. The example below filters events which have vehicleclas "C" and amount greater than 300. [Read more. ](generic_filtering.html).

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	filter(vehicleclass == "C", amount > 300)
```

## select

Variables on a event log can be _selected_ using `select()`. By default, `select()` will always make sure that the mapping-variables are retained. Otherwise, it would no longer function as an eventlog.

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	select(vehicleclass)
```

By setting the argument `force_df = TRUE`, the mapping-variables will not be retained, and the output will be a data.frame, and not an event log. Not that this is true even in the case that all mapping variables are selected. 

```{r}
traffic_fines %>%
	select(case_id, vehicleclass, amount, force_df = TRUE)
```

### Selecting (a set of) ids

Similar to `group_by_ids()`, `select_ids()` can be used to select a (set of) mapping variables. 

```{r}
patients %>%
	select_ids(case_id, activity_id)
```
Note again how the arguments are unquoted id-functions instead of raw variable names. The result of `select_ids()` will __always__ be `data.frame`, as typically not all ids in the mapping will be selected. 


## arrange

Event data can be sorted using the `arrange` function. `desc` can be used to sort descending on an attribute.

```{r}
#sort descending on time
patients %>%
	arrange(desc(time))
```






```{r footer, results = "asis", echo = F}
CURRENT_PAGE <-  stringr::str_replace(knitr::current_input(), ".Rmd",".html")
res <- knitr::knit_expand("_button_footer.Rmd", quiet = TRUE)
res <- knitr::knit_child(text = unlist(res), quiet = TRUE)
cat(res, sep = '\n')
```
